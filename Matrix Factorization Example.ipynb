    "# Example of Matrix Factorization\n",
    "Show how a matrix can be broken down into two smaller matrices. In this example, an image of the surface of the sun is used as a 2D matrix. This matrix could also be a users/ratings martix like in a reccomender system\n",
    "\n",
    "The original matix is call V and the two new matrices are called W and H. W and H are selected such that V=W.dot(H)\n",
    "\n",
    "To satisfy the rules of the matrix multiplication, if the dimension of V is (m)x(n), the dimensions of W must be (m)x(p) and the dimensions of H must be (p)x(n). Note that in matrix multiplication, the inner dimension (p) must be the same in the two matrices and cancels out. Therefore, p can be any number, regardless of the size of V.\n",
    "\n",
    "If p is a larger number, W.dot(H) will faithfully reproduce V. As p decreases, W.dot(H) will be an approximation of V, with decreased fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Breaking a matrix down into two smaller matrices povides the following benefits:\n",
    "1. Reduces the amount of data necessary to store the matrix. If the first matrix is (m)x(n) and the smaller matrices are (m)x(p) and (p)x(n), the amount of data in the two matrices will be smaller than in the first matrix if p < (nm)/(n+m).\n",
    "2. Provides some error-correction or ability to fill in missing data. If there are some missing data points in V, (for example, most users have seen and rated a movie, but a few have not), the approximation W.dot(H) will fill in approximate values for the missing data based on the row and column around that data point\n",
